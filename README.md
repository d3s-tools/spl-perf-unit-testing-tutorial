# Performance Unit Testing Tutorial

The repository contains a simple application that emulates reading a list
of transactions in an e-shop. There are several commits that aims to improve
the performance of the application. Performance unit tests in SPL are then
added to the repository to validate the assumptions about performance
improvements.

The `master` branch represents the repository of the application itself,
without performance tests. These tests are available under the `solution`
branch.

See <http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/software/spl-java> for more information about
performance unit testing with SPL.
